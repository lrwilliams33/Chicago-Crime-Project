# Chicago-Crime-Project

This project was created as a final project for COP3530 course (Data Structures & Algorithms) at the University of Florida. Project by Landon Williams, Terry Lu, and Jack Wardlaw.

This project is analysis of 2020 crime data from the City of Chicago.
See data here: https://data.cityofchicago.org/Public-Safety/Crimes-2020/qzdf-xmn8

Users can use Tim Sort or Quick Sort to sort crimes in the 77 community areas of chicago by their Block (street) and view information about the crimes in that community area including their case number, if they resulted in arrest, and if they were domestic. Users can also view the community areas of Chicago with the most crimes and the least crimes.
